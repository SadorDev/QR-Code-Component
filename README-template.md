## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

For this project, I wanted to use SCSS for the styling. I watched some tutorials on YouTube and read the docs to know how to start using SCSS.

I learnt how to implement varibles and functions in SCSS.
I learnt to use mixin for a variable in SCSS
I learnt to always write css in SCSS which overwrites the styling in CSS


I remembered the four values for margin and padding go from top, right, bottom, left
I remembered to use px for width in order to make main content not responsive which was not needed for this challenge



Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

### Continued development

I still want to be using SCSS for future challenges. I am comfortable with CSS and using Flexbox, however SCSS is a tool I want to be using consistently in order to get better
